# Homework

## Start the homework

Need to brush up on the homework setup process? Check [this](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/Git/blob/main/homework_hand_in.md) out before you get into some git confusion!

## Todo list

Using `create-react-app` create a new react project.

## basic React & props

Render a basic static todo list with three items:

```
Todo List

* Get out of bed, Wed Sep 13 2017
* Brush teeth, Thu Sep 14 2017
* Eat breakfast, Fri Sep 15 2017
```

For each item render a description and a deadline date. Before you start draw a mockup and identify the components with colours. You have to use more than two components. Think which props the components should take.

## thinking in React
