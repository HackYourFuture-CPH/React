# Homework

Base your week 3 homework on the result of week 2.

## Outline

Extend your todo list app with the ability to add new todo items and remove existing ones.

Create an add button and a text input. When the add button is clicked a new todo item is created with the given
description and deadline. Create also a remove button, which when clicked it should remove the todo item from the list.

> Challenge: figure out a way for users to enter the deadline date. This is a great opportunity to think like a community in a wider development community. Perhaps there are some **react** libraries out there that provide some kind of **date picker**? Also, look at **momentjs** to see if it could be useful.
