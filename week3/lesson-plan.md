# Lesson Plan - Advanced react

## Forms
Forms works out of the box exactly like plain html.

but if we need to handle form submission in javascript and keep track of what data the user enters in the form, then we use [controlled inputs](#controlled-inputs)

### Controlled Inputs
- Docs [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)

- Uncontrolled inputs are almost never useful to us

- For controlled inputs, we must provide _both_:
  - The value
  - The onChange event handler

- React controls the state of the input, not the browser

## Using data fetching
- Setting up fetching in `componentDidMount`
- Talk about loading states


## Prop types **Should we even teach this??**


## Children
Make a simple example of using `props.children`. Fx the fancyborder component used in [this example](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html#containment)
