# Lesson Plan - Building components
- Stateful logic - Having logic around state

## Create react app
Show students how to install create react app. https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

- Explain the general structure
- How to run `npm run start`
- Talk briefly about how the dist folder is generated


## Component tree
Transform a todolist sketch into components on white board. 

*Exercise:* transform another ui into components in pairs.

## stateful logic
1. Using destructuring in React
2. State vs. Props
    - Both props and state trigger a render update when they change
    - How to determine if data should be props or state?
      - Props are "configuration options" for components
      - State is completely optional
      - State increases complexity and reduces predictability
      - Use props unless you definitely need to use state
      - State is single-level only. Components can read and set their own state, but cannot read or set the state of their children
    - Later, we are going to be using a state-management tool

3. Using state correctly
    - Do not modify state directly, always use setState
        - Give an example of how mutating state directly doesnâ€™t work
    - State updates are merged (note that merging is shallow)
    - setState is an asynchronously-executed _request_ to change state

## List keys
- Render list first without adding the key. See the error
- Assignment of unique key to every item rendered in an array
- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed
- [Index should be avoided](https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318)

## Lifecycle Methods
- Full list [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)
- Lifecycle methods are used when render is not enough on its own
- Cover each, giving examples of when they might be useful
  - componentDidMount: data fetching in client-side-only apps
  - shouldComponentUpdate: performance debugging
  - componentWillUnmount: teardown (payment SDKs, intervals, etc)

- Question: in which of these lifecycle methods is it OK to call setState? (watch out for stack overflows)
