# Homework

## Time Registration

#### Create the time registration app from week3 lesson plan. 
#### Only authenticated users should be allowed to use it.
- This means that you can NOT use this api : https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benna100/5fd674171ea528d7cd1d504e9bb0ca6f/raw to get the shifts.
- Instead you will have to send the shifts from your own backend. 
- To authenticate the user, the token must be send to the backend and verified before sending back the content.
- Please refer to this example to see how its done 
- [Firebase front- and backend example](https://github.com/senner008/Firebase-React-Express.git)
#### Use email and password authentication and google oAuth with firebase

## Hand in Homework:

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feyBVDhFQuk) for a more detailed go-through of how to hand in homework!

- Create a new branch called `react/week4` 
- Add all your changes to this branch in the `react/week4` folder. 
- Go through the [Homework checklist](#homework-checklist)
- Create a pull request using the `react/week4` branch
- Wait for mentor feedback
- Implement feedback, `add`, `commit` and `push` the changes
- Now you can merge the changes into `master`
- When merged you can **share the github link** to your classes slack channel if you are **proud of what you did** ðŸ’ª
- Now celebrate ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Homework checklist
Go over your homework one last time:

- [ ] Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- [ ] Have you used `const` and `let` and avoided `var`?
- [ ] Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- [ ] Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md))?
