# Homework

- The github search becomes the home page of your project.
- When you list the github users you can click on individual users to navigate to the profile
- In the profile component you need to fetch details about the github user and display them in a nice way using css, you can get inspiration from [a github profile](https://github.com/younesmln)
- Create an about page and fill it with some relevant info about the project (used technologies as an example maybe).
