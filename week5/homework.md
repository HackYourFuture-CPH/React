# Homework

- The github search becomes the home page of your project.
- When you list the github users you can click on individual users to navigate to the profile
- In the profile component you need to fetch details about the github user and display them in a nice way using css, you can get inspiration from [a github profile](https://github.com/younesmln)
- Create an about page and fill it with some relevant info about the project (used technologies as an example maybe).

**Get A single User API ** https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user

## Hand in Homework:

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feyBVDhFQuk) for a more detailed go-through of how to hand in homework!

- Create a new branch called `react/week5` 
- Add all your changes to this branch in the `react/week5` folder. 
- Go through the [Homework checklist](#homework-checklist)
- Create a pull request using the `react/week5` branch
- Wait for mentor feedback
- Implement feedback, `add`, `commit` and `push` the changes
- Now you can merge the changes into `master`
- When merged you can **share the github link** to your classes slack channel if you are **proud of what you did** ðŸ’ª
- Now celebrate ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Homework checklist
Go over your homework one last time:

- [ ] Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- [ ] Have you used `const` and `let` and avoided `var`?
- [ ] Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- [ ] Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md))?
