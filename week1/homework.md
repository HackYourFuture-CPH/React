# Homework

usign `create-react-app` create a new react project.

## basic React & props

Render a basic static todo list with three items:

```
Todo List

* Get out of bed, Wed Sep 13 2017
* Brush teeth, Thu Sep 14 2017
* Eat breakfast, Fri Sep 15 2017
```

For each item render a description and a deadline date. Before you start draw a mockup and identify the components with colours. You have to use more than two components. Think which props the components should take.

## thinking in React
go through this section of react official documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html for learning how to think the react way.

## Hand in Homework:

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feyBVDhFQuk) for a more detailed go-through of how to hand in homework!

- Create a new branch called `react/week1` 
- Add all your changes to this branch in the `react/week1` folder. 
- Go through the [Homework checklist](#homework-checklist)
- Create a pull request using the `react/week1` branch
- Wait for mentor feedback
- Implement feedback, `add`, `commit` and `push` the changes
- Now you can merge the changes into `master`
- When merged you can **share the github link** to your classes slack channel if you are **proud of what you did** ðŸ’ª
- Now celebrate ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Homework checklist
Go over your homework one last time:

- [ ] Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- [ ] Have you used `const` and `let` and avoided `var`?
- [ ] Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- [ ] Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md))?
