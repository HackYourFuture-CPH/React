# Homework

## Github users search

your homework will be searching github users based on the what you type in the input. Use this api: `https://api.github.com/search/users?q=${query}`

Requirements: 
- When the search is loading, you should show "loading..."
- When the search is failed, you should show "error fetching (reason why it failed)..."
- When the search result is empty (no users), you should show "No results..."
- All state should be managed using the context api!

## Working with github api

- Continue using the github API through this url - https://api.github.com (Hint: use postman to query the github API)
- By querying the above url you will view all the api urls that the github API has. You can try to explore them, we recommend that you read the github API documentation. (https://developer.github.com/v3/#current-version)
    - You can try to retrieve the repos data from the HackYourFuture-CPH organisation - (Hint: https://api.github.com/users/.../repos)
    - You can try to display the name of all the repos in your React app
    - If this is to easy for you... surprise us with your creativity... build up on your project and we will have a look!! ;)

## Hand in Homework:

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feyBVDhFQuk) for a more detailed go-through of how to hand in homework!

- Create a new branch called `react/week4` 
- Add all your changes to this branch in the `react/week4` folder. 
- Go through the [Homework checklist](#homework-checklist)
- Create a pull request using the `react/week4` branch
- Wait for mentor feedback
- Implement feedback, `add`, `commit` and `push` the changes
- Now you can merge the changes into `master`
- When merged you can **share the github link** to your classes slack channel if you are **proud of what you did** ðŸ’ª
- Now celebrate ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Homework checklist
Go over your homework one last time:

- [ ] Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- [ ] Have you used `const` and `let` and avoided `var`?
- [ ] Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- [ ] Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md))?
