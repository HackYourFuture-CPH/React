# Meal sharing homework overview

This section provides you an overview of which meal sharing parts should be completed **before** the meal sharing session itself.
Those are the parts implemented as parts of homework, starting with the node module.

## Meal sharing session

- find a meal by title, use your `title` query parameter. Have a search bar above your `MealsList` in the `/meals` page.
- sort by `sortKey` and use `sortDir` query parameters (`when`, `max_reservations` and `price`  should be available as per previous homework). Flip between ⬆️ and ⬇️ for sorting direction or implement it in a different way of your choice.
- show how many spots for reservations are left on the `Meal` component.
