# Lesson Plan - Connecting to node

- Having a boilerplate that runs node connected to a sql database and React. The node api uses the database table, React uses the node api.
- React router
- Refs

## Code inspiration

### Node React
Simple React app using node with express as backend. Rendering users.

#### Possible extensions
- Creating a new user using a `POST` request with `fetch`
  - Do it both with controlled inputs and refs
- Every user should have a seperate about page
  - When the list of users is rendered link to the users about page
