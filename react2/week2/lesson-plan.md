# Lesson Plan - Connecting to node

- A backend app that runs node.js with express. The node api uses an in-memory list, React can "GET" and "POST" to the list
- React router
- Frontend validation

### Node React

#### Backstory: 
You have been hired in a company to maintain a web application, congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
The application can submit and display shifts and uses React to communicate with a backend written in node.js/express.
On the first day on your new job you are handed a bug report by the QA person. 
'Since they hired you to be the new expert, this should be a breeze' he says. 

### EXERCISE:

1. Clone the app and get it running. First start the backend, then the frontend.
2. Go through the bug report and discuss which bugs you prioritize.

### BUG REPORT: ðŸª²ðŸª²ðŸª²

1. A link leading to the shift submission page is missing on the shifts overview page.
2. The user can submit a shift where the endDate is before the start date.
3. A user name with numbers can be submitted.
4. The shifts list should be searchable and only show the 10 latest submissions. Each shift should therefore include a timestamp so that it can be sorted.
5. The app looks terrible! Please add some styling.
6. The input error validation should be specific to the error.
