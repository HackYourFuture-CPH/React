- [Constants](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)

- [Rest Parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)
- [Spread Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
