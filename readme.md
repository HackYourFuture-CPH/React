React is free an open-source frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. We will learn React to empower us to build even more complex applications faster.

Next.js is a popular framework which further enhances the development process and performance of our web applications. Next.js builds on top of React by adding several features and optimizations that are often required in modern web applications.

# Beyond Next.JS

Unfortunately, we won't be able to cover all areas of React in this course, but only the essentials. There are a lot of powerful tools out there for you to learn after you finish this course such as:

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - a way to annotate ES6 with types
- **[Redux](https://flowtype.org)** - predictable (application) state container, a Flux implementation
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Open-source CSS framework
