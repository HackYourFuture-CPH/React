## Read up before we get started

Watch this video from Facebook about why they started React:

Also be sure you're familiar with ES6-syntax. This is a handy reference of all features of ES6:

http://es6-features.org

Please _do not worry about understanding all_. However, do make sure you understand the following, as we'll be using them a lot:

- http://es6-features.org/#Constants
- http://es6-features.org/#ObjectMatchingShorthandNotation
- http://es6-features.org/#RestParameter
- http://es6-features.org/#SpreadOperator

# Beyond React

The following libraries are worth mentioning to use in conjunction with React:

- **[FlowType](https://flowtype.org)** - a way to annotate ES6 with types, similar to TypeScript
- **[Redux](https://flowtype.org)** - predictable (application) state container, a Flux implementation
- **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)** - a JS packager, used by `create-react-app`
- **[Babel](https://babeljs.io)** - a ES6+ to JS transpiler, also used by `create-react-app`
- **[JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss)** - a way to write CSS-like styles inside your component files
